# LeetCode Problem 322: [Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

## Problem Description

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money `amount`. Write a function to compute the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

## Solution Approach
This is a very classic dynamic programming algorithm. However, for someone not familiar with the concept, it can be tricky. Here we tackle the problem recursively, for each coin, if I take that coin into account, then the fewest number of coins we can get is 1+coinChange(amount-that_coin_value). So for all the coins, we return the smallest number as min(1+coinChange(amount-coin1_value), 1+coinChange(amount-coin2_value, ......).
Then we observed that this algorithm may compute coinChange of same amount for many times, which are kind of duplicate, if we can store "amount->fewest_coin_count" into array, then we don't need to recompute again. Actually, this is DP (dynamic programming), 

## Java Solution

class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] amounts = new int[amount+1];

        Arrays.fill(amounts, amount+1);

        amounts[0]=0;

        for(int i=1; i<=amount; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<coins.length; j++){
                if(i>=coins[j]){
                    amounts[i] = Math.min(amounts[i], 1+amounts[i-coins[j]]);
                }         
            }
        }

        if(amounts[amount] == amount+1){
            return -1;
        }

        return amounts[amount];
    }
}
