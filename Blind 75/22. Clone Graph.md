# LeetCode Problem 133: [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

## Problem Description

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

## Solution Approach

To clone the graph, we perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the original graph. We use a HashMap to keep track of visited nodes and their corresponding cloned nodes. At each step of the DFS traversal, we create a new node and add it to the HashMap. We then recursively traverse the neighbors of the current node and add them to the neighbor list of the cloned node. Finally, we return the cloned graph.

## Java Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    HashMap<Node, Node> mp = new HashMap<>();
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        if (mp.containsKey(node)) return mp.get(node);

        mp.put(node, new Node(node.val));
        for (Node val : node.neighbors) {
            mp.get(node).neighbors.add(cloneGraph(val));
        }

        return mp.get(node);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of nodes (vertices) and \(E\) is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V)\) for the HashMap to store visited nodes.
